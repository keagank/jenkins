Hello there,

Checking your account I see you have instances in the us-east-1 and sa-east-1 regions. So for total completeness of this case I will be increasing both regions limits.

The limit increase request for EIPs in the us-east-1 and sa-east-1 regions have been approved and processed and your new limit is 10 for both regions. Please note that this could take up to 15mins to propagate and become available for use.

If you require more EIPs in this region or a different region, you can fill in this easy support form to apply for more EIPs [1].

If you have any other queries or would like any additional information please do not hesitate to get back to us.
